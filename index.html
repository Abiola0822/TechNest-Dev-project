                Penelope is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2012 animated feature film Wreck-It Ralph and its 2018 sequel. 
                She is a young, sharp-tongued racer that originates from the candy-themed racing game Sugar Rush.
                Penelope is adventurous, optimistic, and compassionate. She is full of life and she follows her dreams, no matter what obstacles she faces along the way.
